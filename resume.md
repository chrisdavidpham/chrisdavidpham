## About Me
I'm a **Sr. Software Developer** with 10+ years of experience architecting cloud-ready, scalable enterprise solutions for major healthcare, finance, and ed-tech organizations. I build web apps, APIs, and event-driven systems using **C#, TypeScript, Angular, React, PowerShell, SQL** and **NoSQL** databases.  

*At work* I connect with my colleagues by practicing trust-building behaviors like initiative, commitment, candor and care. My connection with others energizes teams and cultivates culture.  

*At home* I find joy in cooperative games, playing guitar, and repairing my home and cars. My third place is the Dojang where I teach Taekwondo and help students master technique, discipline, and respect.
