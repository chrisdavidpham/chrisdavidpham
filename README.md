### About
I'm a full-stack software engineer passionate of leading by example. I grow my technical mastery by solving new and challenging problems, and I expand my influence by meeting new people and fostering relationships.

My skills include the design, development, and delivery of multi-tier, cloud-ready enterprise .NET and Node.js apps. I use my knowledge, creativity, and leadership to help businesses identify risks, find solutions, and build robust, scalable systems.
