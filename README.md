### About
I'm a technologist, musician, and creator who's energized by cooperative work, music composition, and building things both digital and physical.

My skills involve the design, development, and delivery of web apps & APIs, business processes, and data ETL on prem or in the cloud.

On the side, I enjoy running an art business with my wife, teaching martial arts, playing drums, racing cars, and DIY home and auto work.
